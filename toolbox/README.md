# Toolbox
Redacted out of conern of privacy.

This folder contained general scripts run by developers that were often useful to repeat. This varied from mass delete user scripts to clean up the test environment to custom DynamoDB queries built to extract data for anaylysis by business and marketing teams.

If a script was found to be used very often, eventually a case was made for it to be introduced into the `admin-service` and attached to the CMS system to save time and allow for ease of use.
